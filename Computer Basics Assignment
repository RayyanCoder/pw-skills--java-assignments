1.What is computer ?

A computer is an electronic device that can perform various tasks, including processing and storing data, running software programs, and connecting to other devices and networks. Computers typically include a central processing unit (CPU), memory, storage, and input/output devices such as a keyboard and monitor. There are many types of computers, including desktop computers, laptops, tablets, and smartphones.

2.What is RAM ?

RAM stands for Random Access Memory. It is a type of computer memory that is used to temporarily store data that the computer is currently using or processing. The information stored in RAM is easily accessible by the computer's central processing unit (CPU) and can be quickly read and written. When the computer is powered off, the data stored in RAM is lost. RAM is considered as a volatile memory. The more RAM a computer has, the more data it can process at one time, which can lead to faster overall performance.

3.where is data store in the computer ?

The primary storage device in a computer is the Random Access Memory (RAM), which is used to temporarily store data while the computer is running.

The secondary storage device in a computer is typically a hard drive or solid state drive (SSD), which is used to permanently store data even when the computer is powered off. These drives use magnetic or flash memory to store data and are typically larger in capacity than RAM.

External storage devices, such as USB drives, external hard drives, and memory cards, can also be used to store data.

4.what is the input device that used to type text and number on the document in the computer ?

keyboard is a input device that is used to type text and number on the document in the computer.

5.what are the output devices ?

1. Monitors or displays, which display text and images on a screen.
2. Printers, which print text and images on paper or other media.
3. Speakers, which play audio.
4. Headphones or earphones, which play audio in a private setting
5. Projectors, which display images or videos on a large screen.
6. Braille readers, which convert text to a tactile form for visually impaired users.
7. Plotters, which are used for printing large graphics and technical drawings.

6.which device allow user to move the cursor or pointer on the screen ?

Mouse is a input device that is used to move the cursor or pointer on the screen.

7.which language is directly understand by the computer without translate the program ?

The language that a computer can understand directly without the need for a translation program is machine language or machine code. It is the lowest-level programming language and consists of binary code that can be directly executed by a computer's processor. It is specific to a particular type of computer architecture and consists of a series of 0s and 1s that correspond to specific instructions for the processor. It is difficult for humans to read and write machine code, so high-level programming languages like C++, Python, and Java are commonly used to write programs that are then translated into machine code by a compiler or interpreter.

8.what are the input devices ?

1)Keyboard, which is used to input text and numbers into the computer.

2)Mouse, which is used to navigate and interact with on-screen elements.

3)Touchpad, which is used to navigate and interact with on-screen elements, commonly found on laptops.

4)Touch screen, which allows direct interaction with on-screen elements by touching the display.

5)Scanner, which captures an image of a document or photo and inputs it into the computer.

6)Microphone, which inputs audio into the computer.
Digital camera, which inputs digital images into the computer.
Game controller, which inputs commands into the computer for gaming.
